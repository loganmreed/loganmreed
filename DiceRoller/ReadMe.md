Statistical Randomness & Dice Simulator (C++)

This is a high preformace dice roll simulator that tests statistical fairness of random number generation. 
This project implements a rigorous mathematical analysis to verify distribution patterns across large datasets.

Low-Level Optimization: Written in C++ with a focus on memory efficiency and execution speed for large-scale simulations (1M+ rolls).

Statistical Validation: Performs frequency analysis to check for "biased" outcomes, mimicking real-world data science validation techniques.
