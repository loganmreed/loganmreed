Cross-Platform Embedded System Monitor

This is a high-precision systems programming tool designed to monitor hardware resource utilization across different kernel architectures. It utilizes Conditional Compilation to provide a unified interface for both Windows and Linux environments, abstracting the complexities of OS-specific system calls behind a clean, Object-Oriented API.
